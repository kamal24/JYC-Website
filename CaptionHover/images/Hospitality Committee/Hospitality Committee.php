<pre>Amidst the picturesque lush green hills, behind mystical clouds hides one of the finest campuses, JUIT, Waknaghat.  Working under a big umbrella of  JYC lies one of the pivotal part of any event Hospitality Committee- the ones taking care of you. We work on the motto –"Where Hospitality meets the bay".  The way each member of the committee presents themselves says a great deal about the inner core - the committee itself. The Committee is helpful, friendly and in tune with each guest's needs and apprehensions providing every aspect like accommodations and needs of the events. We are the first face everyone sees, representing what JYC is about and we are responsible for making sure that everything is done to make every attendees  first visit a pleasant one. We ensure that you feel  as quoted- 'It's said they never forget, neither will you'.</pre>
