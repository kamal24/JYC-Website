"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment"
Disciplinary Committee was formed during the very first LeFiestus of JUIT. Since then it has been an essential and active part of JYC. The committee follows the simple rule that teaches us to operate by principle rather than desire. Saying no to our impulses puts us in control of our appetites rather than vice versa. It deposes our lust and permits truth, virtue, and integrity to rule our minds instead. Discipline isn't about showing the person who is the boss, it's about taking responsibility for the individual's action. The main purpose of the disciplinary committee is to let the fellow students have fun in a carefree environment. We ensure that any event happening in JUIT is completed with least bit of conflicts.
A person's attitude toward discipline is the measure of that person's own orientation to order.
