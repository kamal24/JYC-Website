<h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT JYC</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_style" style="color:#FDF3E7;opacity:0.7">Because Education is not just about academics, it's not just about the corridors ringing with the sound of the feet trotting away after a tiresome day, it's not about the fluttering pages in the library that speak of the impending exams and tests. Education is a lot more and a man is recognized more by his talents in today's competitive world.

JYC: The student body of our college is here to provide a new meaning to college life, and make students explore the vistas of life, while imbibing in them the virtues of cooperation, unity, friendship and equality. The JYC, with its various clubs covers all aspects of development and enjoyment in life. While for the ones with a flair for the pen, the literary club is the arena, the ones with the speed and agility in their limbs, find sports club as their favorite destination. With this is the environment club, the movie club, the tech club and of course, the Event management club which all not only provide enjoyment and add fun to the general college atmosphere, but also teach the members to easily make a transition from loyal and dedicated followers to charismatic leaders of substance.

The JYC is constituted with the President, Secretary and Treasurer as the high office and the club coordinators working with them as the driving force of their cabinet. The members include students of the 1st and 2nd year who act as the work force behind this beautiful collection. The Faculty Incharge is the chief advisor to the board and the light in the darkness for all.


The JYC is, thus, a well constituted body that acts to ensure that the students of the college feel full of energy and always have something constructive going on in their minds. It works to make life tinkling with joy and in the meantime also establishes a hierarchy which students learn to respect and admire.

So, what can be better than the beautiful hills, the sultry mist and the beautiful college. and in the midst of it, a huge collection of people related by duty, respect and joy. As the hills beckon, so does JYC, and with it the voice of all the JUITians.
