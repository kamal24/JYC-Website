<pre>“Every child is an artist, the problem is staying an artist when you grow up”   -Pablo Picasso\r\nAccording to Arts club, we define Arts as :The expression of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.\r\nThe purpose of Arts Club is to bring student and professional artwork to the mass student population of JUIT. As we know JUIT is a beautiful place we make students  aware of the beauty of God’s creation around us, and experiment on this beauty through their art work and provide opportunities and encouragement to express oneself freely.\r\nThe hectic schedule of college hardly leaves students to pursue their passion,imagine and dream creatively and think out of the box. Arts club encourages students to play with their hobbies and creatively entertain and relax themselves through paintings,music and drama and energize themselves with a positive and fulfilling energy.</pre>
