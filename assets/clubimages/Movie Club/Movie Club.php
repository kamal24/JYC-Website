Describing an event, a lifetime, an expression, a glimpse, a memory and a thousand emotions is what a movie can do…. It does affect you, is inspired by you and is for you. It serves the purpose of entertainment as it creates what we call movies, masti and magic. That is all what entertainment is all about. Having a packed 9:00 to 5:00 schedule within a world of its own, ideally we would be dull technocrats if we did not have a zing in JUIT. Bringing all the fun to a sparkling, state of the art Auditorium, in our JUIT world every single Saturday, it is pure entertainment we provide. Making every movie make a mark of it's own. We call our work an "art", it’s part of show business, the business of creating entertainment. Truly said there are specific clubs in JYC doing specific jobs, but as for making everybody relax and putting a smile on everyone’s face is something that we do best.
