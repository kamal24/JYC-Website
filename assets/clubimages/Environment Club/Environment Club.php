<pre>“Be the change you want to see in the world.”\r\n\r\nThe earth, the air, the land and the water are not an inheritance from our fore fathers but on loan from our children. So we have to handover to them at least as it was handed over to us.\r\nNature has inspired poetry, art, literature, religion, music, dance and even philosophy. Yet, nature the fount of virtually all human inspiration, the source of all life, finds itself under relentless attack from its prodigal son ‘Home sapiens’. We have become distanced from nature. \r\nWith environmentalism on the rise, the environment club was formed by Pavit Verma to set an example for everyone to realize that indeed our natural resources are of great importance to our lives, and, that though we utilize such resources we need to maintain them in a manner that we do not lose them or even risk losing them as an allegiance to the environment. The club organizes concatenation with the motto of spreading environmental awareness via interactive educational activities, service learning and development of active conservation practices on campus.\r\n Through the various events we try to influence the local attitudes towards the environment in a positive way, help people gain skills that benefit the environment, encourage group participation in meaningful activities that improve the environment and environmental conditions.\r\n “If we surrendered to earth’s intelligence we could rise up rooted, like trees.”</pre>
