<pre>“In Photography and Madness, THERE ARE NO PRINCIPLES.”\r\n“There is one thing the photograph must contain, the humanity of the moment. This kind of photography is realism. But realism is not enough – there has to be vision, and the two together can make a good photograph”\r\nRobert Frank\r\nThe Photography club captures the moments. That is for what the club was formed 2 years back. Since then the club has given various good photographs of our university, various members have attended the fest of colleges all around India and won many awards. The club has organized various workshops on ADOBE PHOTOSHOP, on how to handle a DSLR and various photo walk’s to enhance the photography skills in students. All the events happening in JUIT are covered by the club members. The members of this club come together during Annual fest to organize various events such as PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION, Online Photography Contest and many more for the biggest annual festival of this university and work together towards the successful execution of the events. </pre>
